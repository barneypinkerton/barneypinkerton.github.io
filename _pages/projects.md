### Discogs ML Recommender  
**Python · Machine Learning · Discogs API**

A recommendation system that ingests the Discogs data dump and API to suggest vinyl records based on my collection, wantlist, label affinities, and listening behaviour.

- Parses Electronic releases into SQLite and engineers features for labels, sub-labels, aliases, and release year.  
- Scores candidate records using a custom weighting system tailored for crate-digging.  
- Prioritises deep-catalog relationships over obvious, mainstream suggestions.
