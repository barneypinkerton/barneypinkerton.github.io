      Hey, I'm Barney!
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m a Master’s student at NYU studying Music Business & Music Technology, and when I get some free time I like to build and tinker with 
      small music tools that help me make sense of what I listen to and discover new sounds I might’ve missed.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also enjoy writing when given the opportunity — especially when I get to blend music with culture, data, and the places that shaped me.

      This site is a home for projects, essays, and anything else I feel like sharing — things that exist somewhere between spreadsheets, headphones, and a book.
