      Hey, I'm Barney! When I get some free time I like to build and tinker with small music tools that help me make sense of what I listen to and discover new sounds 
      I might’ve missed. I’m currently studying a Master of Music Business and Music Technology at NYU. When I get the chance, I also enjoy writing—especially when I 
      get to blend music with culture, personal history and the places that shaped me.

      This site is a home for the projects, essays, articles and anything else I feel like sharing—pieces that sit somewhere between spreadsheets, headphones and a book.
