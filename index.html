      I’m a data-driven music nerd working at the intersection of listening data,
      recommendation systems, and artist careers. I’m currently studying Music
      Business and Music Technology at NYU and spend most of my time building
      Discogs-powered vinyl recommenders, Apple Music listening dashboards, and
      other slightly over-engineered music tools.

      This site is a home for the projects, writing, and experiments that sit
      somewhere between spreadsheets and sound systems.
