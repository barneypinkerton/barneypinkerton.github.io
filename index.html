      Hi, i'm Barney. I spend most of my time building small music tools that help me make sense of what I listen to and discover new sounds I might’ve missed. I’m currently studying Music Business and Music Technology at NYU, and I also enjoy writing—especially when I get to blend music with culture, personal history, and the places that shaped me.

      This site is a home for the projects, writing, and experiments that sit
      somewhere between spreadsheets and sound systems.
